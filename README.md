# old_school_snake_game

This project is build based upon a lesson in the "100 days of code" course on Udemy
https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/20356587#overvie

However, the lesson only provides some basics.

In this game project I added the following functionality:
- several difficulty levels
- snake appears on the opposite side of the screen when it goes into a wall
- several wall blocks appear on the screen when you choose the hardcore difficulty
- food moves to another place when it's located too close to a wall block
- the game keeps tracks of the high score (record score)
